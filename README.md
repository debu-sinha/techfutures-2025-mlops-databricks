Welcome to the **TechFutures 2025** hands-on workshop:  
**"End-to-End MLOps Pipelines on Databricks: From Model Training to Production."**

Led by **Debu Sinha ‚Äî Lead Applied AI/ML Engineer at Databricks** and author of  
*Practical Machine Learning on Databricks*.

## üß† Workshop Overview

In this workshop, you'll learn how to build and scale a **complete MLOps lifecycle** on Databricks:

- Train and track models using **PyTorch + MLflow**
- Register and govern models with **Unity Catalog**
- Deploy and serve models using **Model Serving / AI Gateway**
- Automate experiments with **Optuna and MLflow nested runs**
- Extend the same workflow to **LLMs via Mosaic AI**

**Pipeline Stages**

1. Data Preparation (Delta Tables)  
2. Model Training (PyTorch + MLflow)  
3. Experiment Tracking (MLflow UI)  
4. Model Registry (Unity Catalog)  
5. Model Serving (REST API / AI Gateway)  
6. Monitoring (Lakehouse Monitoring + Alerts)

## ü§ñ LLMOps Lifecycle ‚Äî Unifying Generative AI Workflows

<img src="images/2.jpg" alt="Databricks LLMOps Lifecycle" width="90%">

**Lifecycle Flow**

1. Data (Prompts & Responses)  
2. Fine-Tuning (Mosaic AI Training)  
3. Tracking (MLflow Metrics + Prompts)  
4. Registry (Unity Catalog Models)  
5. Serving (Databricks Model Serving)  
6. Evaluation (LLM-as-a-Judge, Metrics, Drift)

### üî¨ Hands-On LLM Fine-Tuning Demos

To bridge the gap between traditional MLOps (Notebooks 1-2) and the upcoming LLMOps notebook, explore these **interactive fine-tuning examples** that demonstrate the same lifecycle principles applied to Large Language Models:

**[üìñ Databricks LLM Fine-Tuning Demos](https://notebooks.databricks.com/demos/llm-fine-tuning/index.html)**

These demos showcase:
- **Classification Fine-Tuning** ‚Äî Specialize models for customer support scenarios using the Chat API
- **RAG Chatbot Fine-Tuning** ‚Äî Optimize conversational AI with retrieval augmentation and conversation history
- **Entity Extraction Fine-Tuning** ‚Äî Train models for specialized extraction tasks (e.g., medical/drug entities)
- **MLflow Evaluation** ‚Äî Measure fine-tuning improvements with built-in evaluation frameworks

**Why These Demos Matter:**
- Apply the **same MLflow + Unity Catalog patterns** from Notebooks 1-2 to LLM workflows
- See how model tracking, versioning, and serving extend to generative AI
- Practice evaluation techniques specific to LLMs (including LLM-as-a-Judge)
- Bridge traditional MLOps foundations with modern LLMOps practices

These demos complement Notebook 3 *(coming soon)* and provide immediate, hands-on practice with production LLM workflows on Databricks.
